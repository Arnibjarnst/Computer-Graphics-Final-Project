For one of my advanced features I implemented Volumetric Path Tracing (VPT) in our renderer. It features homogeneous participating media,
various phase functions, MIS and a simple path tracer (MATS)

Medium in the renderer can either be attached to geometric primitives (mesh/sphere) or to the camera. The user can attach an interior and an exterior
medium to shapes and if no medium is attached to a shape then rays bouncing off that shape will stay in the same medium else it will take that shapes medium
(no medium on one side means vacuum). The ray will initially be in the cameras medium.

I also created a trivial bsdf which allows users to create invisible medium boundaries.

**Phase Functions**

Phase functions are a very simple class with only one function, sample, that takes in a vector wi and samples a vector wo. The only reason it is a nori class
in stead of a function is to be able to modularly attach it to media objects. I implemented 2 phase functions, an isotropic one and the Henyey-Greenstein phase function

**Medium**

Medium is a class that has a phase function and in the case of the homogoneous medium absorbing and scattering coefficients for each color channel. On top of that it
has two methods, <code>tr()</code> to calculate the transmission over a given distance and <code>sample()</code> to sample a free path and
a direction at the scattering location.

The homogeneous medium samples by choosing a random color channel, sampling with that channel extinction coefficient and then weighing the results with
multiple importance sampling using the pdfs of all the channels.

**Volumetric Integrators**

I created two integrators, both basen on multiple importance sampling. One that considers media boundaries as occluding when sampling emitters in the scene, this one
matches the volumetric integrator in mitsuba (MIS Simple). The other does not consider media boundaries occluding but calculates the transmittance of the shadow ray and multiplies
it with the emitter sampling contribution (MIS). This gives better performance around boundaries.

**Validation**

Below are comparisions of the simple MIS integrator and the mitsuba integrator first with constant coefficients.

I also compared my two integrators and as we can see that they converge to the same solution.

I also compared scenes with spectrally varying absorption and scattering coefficients, $\sigma_a = [9.0, 0.5, 2.5], \sigma_s = [1.0, 0.5, 2.5]$. Here I compare my
two integrator with the mitsuba renderer as well as using the MIS free path sampling strategy I also render one scene that simply uses the maximum extinction coefficient.
As we can see using MIS for the free path sampling significantly reduces noise when the extinction coefficient has high variety.

### Resampled Importance Sampling (RIS)
In importance sampling, samples are drawn from a probability density function $g$ with values proportional to the function being integrated. However, drawing samples from $g$ requires its integration. RIS provides an alternative approach: it involves obtaining multiple samples $x_i$ from a base distribution $p$, easier to integrate, and selecting one of these with a probability proportional to $g(x_i)/p(x_i)$. To implemet this feature, I've created some new integrators, both for direct illumiation and path tracing.

For direct illumination, our integrator estimates the value of the integral $\int_{H^2} f_r(x, \omega_i, \omega_o) L_i(x, \omega_i) \cos \theta_i \d \omega_i$. A good distribution to use for this estimation is $g(\omega_i) = pdf_{ems}(\omega_i) pdf_{mat}(\omega_i)$. On the other hand, there are multiple possible candidates for $p$: in the file `direct_ris_ems.cpp`, $p = pdf_{ems}$ is used, in `direct_ris_mats.cpp` we use $p = pdf_{mat}$, and in `direct_ris_hemi.cpp` $p$ is cosine distributed on the unit hemisphere.

One can notice that for the EMS integrator, RIS shows the same artifacts present in the importance sampling. This is to be expected, since the sampling function used is the same.

</div>

For the MAT integrator, we can notice that, because of the probability density used, RIS creates some of the artifacts seen for the EMS integrator. However, the noise in the region more distant from the light is significantly reduced.

    <img src="../../validation/ris/direct_mat/odyssey_ris20.png" alt="Ems RIS (M=20)" class="img-responsive">
</div>

Similar results can be observed when sampling the cosine-weighted hemisphere.

</div>

For global illumination, RIS can be used do estimate the BSDF value in a more robust way. In this case, RIS is used to select a direction upon encountering a diffuse surface. This selection is based on the probability density $g = pdf_{mat}$. I've integrated this new selection technique both in the `PathMAT` and in the `PathMIS` integrator.

For the validation, I limited the samples per pixel to 32, to better observe the variance in the images. One can see that, for this application, RIS does not manage to have an effect as significat as in direct illumination. However, especially for the case M=20, a reduction of the noise can still be observed looking at the interior of bowl in the scene.
